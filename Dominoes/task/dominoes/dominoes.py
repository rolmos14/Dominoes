            Initially there are 28 pieces which are used for the game. At the beginning of the game, 7 pieces go to
            Computer player (computer_pieces) and another 7 go to Player (player_pieces). Then players can get pieces
            from stock when they cannot continue playing with their pieces.
            It is stored as nested lists, one per piece.
        computer_pieces : list
            contains the current pieces of the Computer player.
            It is stored as nested lists, one per piece.
        player_pieces : list
            contains the current pieces of the Player.
            It is stored as nested lists, one per piece.
        domino_snake : list
            contains the current status of the game.
            It is stored as nested lists, one per piece.
        status : str
            stores the next turn 'player'/'computer' or the end-game condition 'player_wins'/'computer_wins'/'draw'.
